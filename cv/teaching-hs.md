# Teaching
#### HIGH-SCHOOL EXPERIENCE

----

I really enjoy being a teacher. I have always liked showing other people how to
do things after I have learned how to do them myself. A large part of that is
probably because I often [struggle to learn new things][sagan], so helping others
to have an easier time learning than I did is a definite source of joy for me. I
definitely believe that teaching is one of my favorite pastimes as a full-time
student. I hope to be [teaching][kinds] at some point in the future.

After being inspired by a [cool new lecturer][sid] during my first semester at
university in Fall 2014, I really wanted to teach students or at least be able to
instruct them during times of struggle. In the following spring was invited to be
a teaching assistant in a [class I had taken in the fall][discrete], and ever
since then I have been in love with being on course staff. I have hopped around
quite a few classes in my department throughout my tenure as a [teaching
assistant][TA] at Cornell.

Interestingly, though, I also have some experience with teaching high-school students.

### Splash! at Cornell

Splash! is a learning initiative/educational outreach program at Cornell that is
based on the [original version][splash-mit] created by students at MIT in 1957.
Splash! sessions are usually held over a weekend, and university students at the
affiliated chapter teach hundreds of high school students all sorts of subjects
that they are interested in. The [Cornell Splash! chapter][splash-cu] started in
Fall 2014, when I was a first-semester freshman. I have been a part of Splash!
since the very beginning, and the teaching and love it fosters for education
makes it one of my favorite activities at school.

I tend to teach mathematically-heavy material in spring semesters and more accessible
material (usually in the humanities) in fall semesters. Here are some of the things
that I've taught before:

### Independent Study Organization

Back when I was in [high school][sbhs], I created an organization for independent
study (eponymously-named) where interested teachers like myself could teach younger
students advanced material. I attracted another scholar, [Davis Liu][davis]
(Princeton '17), who saw the value in teaching and agreed to volunteer his time
and co-teach with me on Sundays. We would go to the local Princeton library
together and teach selected material from [AP Calculus-AB][calc-ab] from
September through May, having learned the material ourselves in the 8th grade.

In particular, our efforts differed from those of standard tutors inasmuch as we
taught the entire curriculum to interested students at an accelerated pace.
Moreover, we did not charge for this program, and instead volunteered, assuming
the printing and administrative overhead costs personally. Davis and I together
taught from September 2010 to May 2013, and then I taught alone in my senior year
of high school, after Davis had already graduated. We attracted a lot of students
because, although our [school curriculum][sbhs-curr] was [quite rigorous][cakir],
a lot of students did not understand how to learn by themselves, so we helped
bridge the gap as older, more experienced students.

Over the years, we collectively taught over 20 interested students, each of whom
took the AP Calculus-AB exam in May and received a score of 4 or 5. We particularly
prided ourselves upon the fact that we did *not* spoon-feed the younger students,
but rather taught them to teach themselves, and provided just enough materials
for them to be able to succeed while asking important questions.

After I graduated from high school, this program ran into legacy mode, and some
former students of ours helped keep it alive for two more years, until *they*
graduated in 2016\. The remnants of the original program can still be found
scattered across the Internet.

* Once upon a time, we maintained a [Google site][iso] for this course, though
  admittedly most of our correspondence was over email. The last-updated date of
  March 3, 2012 says more than enough.

* All of the files we used to run the course can be found on [Dropbox][iso-dropbox].
