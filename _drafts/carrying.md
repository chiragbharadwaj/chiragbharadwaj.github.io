title: The Culture of Carrying
kind: article
layout: post
excerpt: |
  I've noticed that there is a huge culture of carrying in the computer science department at Cornell. People trade favors, working on entire projects by themselves to have their partner owe them a favor when it's convenient instead of powering through it together. I explore this cultural phenomenon and describe its benefits and tradeoffs from a fresh perspective.

Topics to discuss:
  * Carrying as a concept
  * Computer science department specifics
  * Project favor-trading (convenience vs. current time)
  * Benefits and tradeoffs
  * Other studying anti-patterns
