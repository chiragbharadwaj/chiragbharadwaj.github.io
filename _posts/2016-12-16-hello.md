excerpt: |
  I've decided to start an academic blog! (Finally.) Stay tuned for all sorts of academic posts (related to computer science and otherwise) as I finish up my undergrad and trudge through graduate school.

It's taken me a while, but I've finally managed to get this site up and running.
Using some pretty helpful (albeit somewhat outdated) [advice][] from my
undergraduate advisor, [Adrian Sampson][adrian], I've built this blog-aware site
using [Jekyll-Bootstrap-3][jb3], which, despite lacking serious documentation, is
admittedly a pretty sweet combination of frameworks once one gets past the
learning curve.

Static-site generation is pretty sick. I'm wondering why on earth I used to
hand-code up my website in the past.

Look forward to seeing more posts on here in the near future as I conquer graduate
school! Maybe one day this page will actually have academic followers. :)

Side note: I should set up an XML RSS feed at some point.
