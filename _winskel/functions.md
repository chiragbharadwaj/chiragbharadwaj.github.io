title: Function Classes as Sets

Let us suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are sets. Then, the function classes $(X \rightharpoonup Y)$
and $(X \rightarrow Y)$ are also sets, where we use the notation $(A \rightarrow B)$
to denote the set of all functions from $A$ to $B$.

We are justified in saying that these function classes are also sets because each
function class $(A \rightarrow B)$ contains a collection of functions with the
property of having domain $A$ and codomain $B$. That is, the function class is
nothing but a set of functions, or a set of sets, since a function is a relation,
which is just a set. The justification comes from the idea that the class is
nothing but a collection of objects with a certain property, namely that of sharing
the same function type.

The result above also holds for partial function classes of the form $(A \rightharpoonup B)$,
since every (total) function is also a partial function.
