					<h1>From humble beginnings...</h1>
					<p class="column-8 centered">
						I was born in Flushing, a diverse (and increasingly-gentrified) neighborhood in the borough of Queens in New York City. I grew up there for a little while, and the culture and livelihood of the area has certainly shaped much of who I am today. I don't think I'll ever forget <a href="http://www.chiragbharadwaj.com/img/flushing.jpg" target="_blank">the parks</a>.

					<h1>My story</h1>
					<p class="column-8 centered">
						Since the Flushing days, I've rocketed on towards <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad" target="_blank">bigger things</a> as my life has progressed. You can find a snapshot of some of the highlights of my life in the timeline below. I view these as key events that really changed part of views or my character in some way over the years.

						<dt><time>1996</time></dt>
						<dd>Born</dd>
						<dd>
							<span class="year">1996</span></br>
							Born in Flushing, NY. I was born on 23 November 1996 at the <a href="http://www.chiragbharadwaj.com/img/hospital.jpg" target="_blank">Flushing Hospital Medical Center</a>, a tiny hospital on the corner of two bustling streets. It was an amazing place to live in. I miss it dearly.
						</dd>
						<dt><time>2004</time></dt>
						<dd>Started learning Spanish</dd>
						<dd>
							<span class="year">2004</span></br>
							What started out as a requirement in school quickly became an obsession for me. I was exposed to many natural languages as a child, and my parents were somewhat of polyglots themselves. I loved learning another language in school; nay, I just loved <a href="http://www.ps130q.org/" target="_blank">school</a>.
						</dd>
						<dt><time>2005</time></dt>
						<dd>Started playing piano</dd>
						<dd>
							<span class="year">2005</span></br>
							I started to learn the piano around April 2005. I had listened to a lot of Evgeny Kissin and Arthur Rubenstein growing up because of my mother, so I grew interested in playing the piano like these masters had done so before me. It didn't help that I grew up in a very Asian-American area, so many of my peers had been playing awhile already. I fit in better after starting.
						</dd>
						<dt><time>2007</time></dt>
						<dd>Moved to Princeton, NJ</dd>
						<dd>
							<span class="year">2007</span></br>
							My family moved to Kendall Park, NJ, a town that borders Princeton, NJ. It is an excellent, safe place to grow up and has a high Asian-American population (read: a solid education system). There are natural, preserved areas, and trees line up the entire (forestal) area.
						</dd>
						<dt><time>2011</time></dt>
						<dd>Became a teacher</dd>
						<dd>
							<span class="year">2011</span></br>
							I realized my passion for teaching around the time I was a sophomore in high school. By this time, I had envisioned and created <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3t7lc8r21p39qz5/AADSufpzebET35UJNsT3yaHla" target="_blank">an independent study program</a> for AP Calculus at my high school, which over twenty students joined over my four years. I taught the entire AP coursework material over the duration of the year. I really realized my potential and my <a href="http://www.chiragbharadwaj.com/files/essay.txt" target="_blank">love for it all</a>.
						</dd>
						<dt><time>2013</time></dt>
						<dd>¡Competente en Español!</dd>
						<dd>
							<span class="year">2013</span></br>
							I became pretty close to professionally-fluent in Spanish after spending nearly ten years on various facets of it in school. I'm proud to say that I also got a 5 on the <a href="http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/exam/exam_information/4554.html" target="_blank">AP exam</a>, which required solid reading, writing, listening, and speaking abilities. Painstaking...
						</dd>
						<dt><time>2014</time></dt>
						<dd>Graduated high school</dd>
						<dd>
							<span class="year">2014</span></br>
							I graduated in the top 1% of my class of 750 in <a href="http://www.sbschools.org/schools/sbhs/" target="_blank">high school</a>. I took about 14 <a href="http://www.sbschools.org/schools/sbhs/school_information/courses.php#listing" target="_blank">AP exams</a> and received 5's on 11 of them and 4's on the other three. I also had an <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat" target="_blank">SAT</a> score of 2330, though I guess that scale is outdated now. I was a good student back in the day.<br>
							Nowadays, not so much... :)
						</dd>
						<dt><time>2015</time></dt>
						<dd>Started learning Japanese</dd>
						<dd>
							<span class="year">2015</span></br>
							After learning Spanish so well, I grew interested in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ct5l3c2i3vdwaju/AABX4ECEKBtUNC2wsSCEUERTa" target="_blank">teaching myself 日本語</a> as my fourth language. I was really interested in it especially because it was a serious challenge (as opposed to Spanish, which had phonetic/structural similarities to English). I'm still working on it today, and it's probably some of the most fun I've ever had learning.
						</dd>
						<dt><time>2016</time></dt>
						<dd>Today</dd>
						<dd>
							<span class="year">Today</span></br>
							Today, I am a senior at <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=prelim&defid=3387396" target="_blank">Cornell University</a>, studying computer science. (I also occasionally dabble in economics, chemistry, and electrical engineering.) However, I do a lot of other things in my free time (read about them below!).
