# About Me

### What's in a name?

<audio id="name" src="{{ site.base }}/media/name.mp3"></audio>

Hi! My name is
  <a onclick="document.getElementById('name').play()">
    <i class="fa fa-volume-up"></i>
    Chirag Bharadwaj</a><sup>1</sup>.
The [IPA][] for my name is `/tʃiraːg bʱaːrədʋaːd͡ʑ/`, in case you are a linguistics
enthusiast. (I sure am.)

The ethnic origins of my name are from the greater Indian subcontinent<sup>2</sup>.
In particular, *Chirag* is from an Indo-centric word that means "light or to
enlighten", and *Bharadwaj* is a family name—after [Bharadwaja][], a great ancient
Indian sage. Supposedly, I am part of a family that can trace their lineage back
to this sage across many generations. My parents gave me the first name that I
have because I was born soon after [Diwali][], which is a festival of lights.

Of course, in Indian culture, the family name comes first, so historically my
name would have been *Bharadwaj Chirag*. Names aside, though, I am not very
culturally Indian at all. I was born and raised in the United States, so a lot
of my views and values are uniquely American. Read more below!

### Origins and the early years

I was born in late November 1996 in [Flushing, NY][flushing-hos]. Flushing is a
small, diverse, and [increasingly gentrified][flushing] neighborhood in the borough
of Queens in New York City. I grew up there for a little while. I don't think I
will ever forget the beautiful [parks][].

Flushing is home to about 70,000 people, of which about 69-70% are of Asian heritage
(like myself), at least according to the [2010 census][census]. I commuted about
40 minutes daily to my elementary school in [Bayside, NY][bayside]. It was a good
time, and it taught me how to navigate the city and deal with many kinds of people
by myself at a young age. Worth the toughness points.

I lived in Flushing until 2007, and the hustle and bustle of the city life was
certainly wonderful.

### Growing up

In November 2007, my parents moved to Princeton, NJ, a relatively quiet neighborhood
in suburbia.

I'm not going to lie, Princeton is [downright beautiful][princeton-2]. There is
so much [greenery][princeton-1] and it feels really nice to be surrounded by so
much forestry in the Garden State. Princeton has many areas that are designated
as "preserved open space", so a lot of the greenery is pretty much legally
required to be there. I remember that my parents had to plant three trees on our
property because NJ state law required every house to have at least that many.
They don't take "the Garden State" lightly, I guess.

Of course, I should be honest—I didn't exactly move to *Princeton*. My parents
moved to a small village just on the border of Princeton. Indeed, since we lived
about ten minutes away from Princeton University, my mother and I would often
attend science talks and music concerts at the university.

I went to junior high and high school in what was actually quite a competitive
school district. The demographics around my area were similar to that of Flushing,
albeit with more non-minority representation.

I graduated at age 17 [near the top][semifinalist] of my class of 750 in high
school in 2014. Through the years, I trudged through a bunch of AP classes in
mathematics and the sciences, ran a lot of track, and became surprisingly fluent
at Spanish.

Currently, I am a senior at Cornell.

My experiences at Cornell aren't too different from what I had expected. At times
it is disillusioning, even humbling, to be in the presence of so many people who
are intellectually gifted. But I am able to learn a lot from these wonderful people,
and to me, that's what makes Cornell really great. Go Big Red!

At Cornell, I take unusual classes (like [nuclear science][nuclear]), participate
in unusual activities (like [Splash!][splash]), and have unusual colleagues for
friends (no comment).

Overall, Cornell is a wonderful experience, and although it has taken me a while
to appreciate it fully, I really love every bit of it. [Ithaca][] has beautiful
[landscapes][], picturesque [winters][], rigorous academics, and Oxford comma
users—a collection of scholarly people who also knew how to have fun. Although
it can be [bleak][] at times, the lovely flora in the [spring][] really make up
for the winters where the temperatures hit [30 below zero][thirty].

P.S. [CKB][] is the best dorm ever. I lived in 2 Court in 2014-2015.

I will be attending graduate school at [Princeton University][princeton] starting
in Fall 2017.

I will be one of the roughly ten or so MSE students in computer science for the
class of 2019. The program requires its students to take around 6 graduate-level
courses, demonstrate competency in their respective specializations within the
field, and then pen and successfully defend a fairly extensive thesis (~50 pages).
I am very excited to be a part of this program and to finally come home after
quite some time away.

Ultimately, I would really like to pursue a [Ph.D.][grad] and then
enter academia on the faculty of a respected institution as I continue to do my
research. Of course, that dream is far, far away, and I am still quite young.
Small steps.
