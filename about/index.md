# About Me

### What's in a name?

<audio id="name" src="{{ site.base }}/media/name.mp3"></audio>

Hi! My name is Chirag Bharadwaj. That's colloquially pronounced as
  <a onclick="document.getElementById('name').play()">
    <i class="fa fa-volume-up"></i>
    SHUH-rahg bah-ruhd-WAHJ</a>,
though the traditional pronunciation (according to [IAST][]) is
actually Chirāg Bhāradvāja. The [IPA][] for my name is `/tʃiraːg bʱaːrədʋaːd͡ʑ/`,
in case you were a linguistics enthusiast. (I sure am.)

The ethnic origins of my name are from the greater Indian subcontinent\*. In
particular, *Chirag* is from an Indo-ethnic word that means "light or to enlighten",
and *Bharadwaj* is a family name—after [Bharadwaja][], a great ancient Indian
sage. Supposedly, I am part of a family that can trace their lineage back to
this sage across many generations. My parents gave me the first name that I have
because I was born soon after [Diwali][], which is a festival of lights.

Of course, in Indian culture, the family name comes first, so historically my
name would have been *Bharadwaj Chirag*. Names aside, though, I am not very
culturally Indian at all. I was born and raised in the United States, so a lot
of my views and values are uniquely American. Read more below!

### Origins and the early years

<div class="row">

<div class="col-sm-6" markdown="1">
I was [born][flushing-hos] in late November 1996 in [Flushing, NY][flushing].
(Before you ask—yes, that's really what Flushing looks like today.) Flushing is
a small and diverse (and increasingly-gentrified) neighborhood in the borough of
Queens in New York City. I grew up there for a little while, and the culture and
livelihood of the area has certainly shaped much of who I am today. I don't think
I'll ever forget the beautiful parks.

Flushing is home to about 70,000 people, of which about 69-70% are Asian and
Asian-American (like myself), at least as of the [2010 census][census]. In fact,
growing up in Flushing, I went many years before I met people who were not from
minority groups, as the diversity on which Flushing prides itself certainly does
exclude a large non-minority population.

I commuted about 40 minutes daily to my primary school in [Bayside, NY][bayside].
It was a good time, and it taught me how to navigate the city and deal with many
kinds of people by myself at a young age. Worth the toughness points.

I lived in Flushing until 2007, and the hustle and bustle of the city life was
certainly wonderful. In November 2007, my parents moved to Princeton, NJ, a
relatively quiet neighborhood (by comparison) in suburbia.

### Growing up

I'm not going to lie, Princeton is [downright beautiful][princeton-2]. There is
so much [greenery][princeton-1] and it feels really nice to be surrounded by so
much forestry in the Garden State. It's especially wonderful in the winter, when
the trees are barren and wonderful white snow fills the land. Princeton also has
many areas that are designated as "preserved open space", so a lot of the greenery
here is pretty much legally required to be there. I remember that my parents had
to plant three trees on our property because NJ state law requires every house to
have at least that many. They don't take "the Garden State" lightly, I guess.

Of course, I should be honest—I didn't exactly move to *Princeton* Princeton. My
parents moved to an area known as Kendall Park, which is a small village just on
the *border* of Princeton. Indeed, we were about five minutes away from Princeton
University, so throughout junior high school, my mother and I would often attend
science talks and music concerts at the university, which were absolutely wonderful.
These excursions definitely served as the initial inspiration that helped shape
my interests today.

<div class="col-sm-6" markdown="1">
I went to junior high and high school near Princeton in what is actually quite a
competitive school district. The demographics around my area were similar to that
of Flushing, albeit with more non-minority representation. Kendall Park, which
is part of the South Brunswick district, was about 40% Asian and Asian-American
back when I was in high school.

I graduated in the top 1% of my class of 750 in high school in 2014 after trudging
through a bunch of AP classes in mathematics and the sciences, conquering the
English language, and becoming surprisingly fluent at Spanish. I do remember being
a [pretty good student][profile] back in the day, and I guess colleges realized
this too. After admission to a few schools, I chose to matriculate to Cornell
University to study computer science, and I headed to [Ithaca][] in Fall 2014 as
a freshly-graduated seventeen-year-old science nerd.

I chose Cornell for its beautiful [landscapes][], picturesque [winters][], rigorous
academics, and of course, its far distance from home (sorry Mom and Dad!). In my
mind, Cornell was the epitome of what I had always wanted—a collection of scholarly
people who also knew how to have fun when needed. And in fact, my experiences at
Cornell aren't too different from what I had expected. At times it is disillusioning,
even humbling, to be in the presence of so many people who are far superior to
me intellectually. But I am able to learn a lot from these wonderful people, and
to me, that's what makes Cornell a really great experience. Go Big Red!

Currently, I am a senior at Cornell—I decided in Fall 2014 that I wanted to graduate
a year early so I could have time to explore and think for that extra year, kind
of like a gap year. I have since decided that if I'm going to spend the next 6 to
8 years in school anyway to get a Ph.D., it's probably better that I shave off a
year somewhere. It was a hard decision to make, though, as balancing the costs of
losing out on a complete social experience as well as taking fewer classes with
the benefits of less financial debt was not so simple. Ultimately, I convinced
myself that I made the right decision for me given my situation, so here I stand
as a second-semester senior, about to graduate one year early.

At Cornell, though, I take some unusual CS courses (like [applied logic][4860]
and [decision theory][5846]), participate in unusual activities (like
[Piano Society][piano] and [Splash!][splash]), and have unusual colleagues for
friends (no comment).

I mostly stick around areas like theory of computation, programming languages,
and computer architecture, as the intersection of these areas forms the core of
my current research interests and my research project with Prof. Adrian Sampson.
However, that is not to say that I don't dabble around other departments occasionally.
I have also hopped around physics, economics, linguistics, electrical engineering,
and even [nuclear science][nuclear] classes. I underestimated the difficulty of
a lot of these departments, and definitely paid the price in my grade-point average,
but ultimately it was worth it to better understand my (broad) interests and get
to participate in various things that I would not have been able to do otherwise.

Overall, Cornell is a wonderful experience, and although it has taken me a while
to appreciate it fully, I really love every bit of it. Ithaca can be [bleak][] at
times, but it's way better than Starkfield, MA, I'll give it that. I think the
lovely greenery in the [spring][] really makes up for the winters where the
temperatures hit 30 below zero. How can you say no to cherry blossom trees?

P.S. CKB is the best dorm ever. I lived in 2 Court in 2014-2015. Amazing experiences,
yo.

### Graduate studies and the future?

I hope to attend graduate school in Fall 2017. Ultimately, I would really like to
pursue a Ph.D. and then enter academia on the faculty of a respected institution
as I continue to do my research. Of course, that dream is far, far away, and I am
still quite young.

For now, I would like to get a taste of what research is like, and I plan on
getting my metaphorical feet wet, as it were, by completing a thesis-based 2-year
M.Sc. degree first, to see if I like it. I suspect I will, but one never knows,
so I look forward to trying this out and seeing where it takes me. I have no idea
where I'll be in five years, but hopefully it's Ph.D. school!

Small steps.
