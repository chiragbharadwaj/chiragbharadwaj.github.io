# About Me

### What's in a name?

<audio id="name" src="{{ site.base }}/media/name.mp3"></audio>

Hi! My name is Chirag Bharadwaj. That's colloquially pronounced as
  <a onclick="document.getElementById('name').play()">
    <i class="fa fa-volume-up"></i>
    SHUH-rahg bah-ruhd-WAHJ</a>,
though the traditional pronunciation (according to [IAST][]) is
actually Chirāg Bhāradvāja. The [IPA][] for my name is `/tʃiraːg bʱaːrədʋaːd͡ʑ/`,
in case you were a linguistics enthusiast. (I sure am.)

The ethnic origins of my name are from the greater Indian subcontinent\*. In
particular, *Chirag* is from an Indo-centric word that means "light or to enlighten",
and *Bharadwaj* is a family name—after [Bharadwaja][], a great ancient Indian
sage. Supposedly, I am part of a family that can trace their lineage back to
this sage across many generations. My parents gave me the first name that I have
because I was born soon after [Diwali][], which is a festival of lights.

Of course, in Indian culture, the family name comes first, so historically my
name would have been *Bharadwaj Chirag*. Names aside, though, I am not very
culturally Indian at all. I was born and raised in the United States, so a lot
of my views and values are uniquely American. Read more below!

### Origins and the early years

<div class="row">

<div class="col-sm-6" markdown="1">
I was [born][flushing-hos] in late November 1996 in [Flushing, NY][flushing].
(Before you ask—yes, that's really what Flushing looks like today.) Flushing is
a small and diverse (and increasingly-gentrified) neighborhood in the borough of
Queens in New York City. I grew up there for a little while, and the culture and
livelihood of the area has certainly shaped much of who I am today. I don't think
I'll ever forget the beautiful parks.

Flushing is home to about 70,000 people, of which about 69-70% are Asian and
Asian-American (like myself), at least as of the [2010 census][census]. In fact,
growing up in Flushing, I went many years before I met people who were not from
minority groups, as the diversity on which Flushing prides itself certainly does
exclude a large non-minority population.

I commuted about 40 minutes daily to my primary school in [Bayside, NY][bayside].
It was a good time, and it taught me how to navigate the city and deal with many
kinds of people by myself at a young age. Worth the toughness points.

I lived in Flushing until 2007, and the hustle and bustle of the city life was
certainly wonderful. In November 2007, my parents moved to Princeton, NJ, a
relatively quiet neighborhood (by comparison) in suburbia.

### Growing up

I'm not going to lie, Princeton is [downright beautiful][princeton-2]. There is
so much [greenery][princeton-1] and it feels really nice to be surrounded by so
much forestry in the Garden State. It's especially wonderful in the winter, when
the trees are barren and wonderful white snow fills the land. Princeton also has
many areas that are designated as "preserved open space", so a lot of the greenery
here is pretty much legally required to be there. I remember that my parents had
to plant three trees on our property because NJ state law requires every house to
have at least that many. They don't take "the Garden State" lightly, I guess.

Of course, I should be honest—I didn't exactly move to *Princeton* Princeton. My
parents moved to an area known as Kendall Park, which is a small village just on
the *border* of Princeton. Indeed, we were about five minutes away from Princeton
University, so throughout junior high school, my mother and I would often attend
science talks and music concerts at the university, which were absolutely wonderful.
These excursions definitely inspired who I am today.

<div class="col-sm-6" markdown="1">
I went to junior high and high school near Princeton in what is actually quite a
competitive school district. The demographics around my area were similar to that
of Flushing, albeit with more non-minority representation. Kendall Park, which
is part of the South Brunswick district, was about 40% Asian-American back when
I was in high school.

I graduated near the top of my class of 750 in high school in 2014 after trudging
through a bunch of AP classes in mathematics and the sciences, conquering the
English language, and becoming surprisingly fluent at Spanish. I remember being
a decent student back in the day, and I guess some colleges thought that too. After
admission to a few schools and some consideration, I chose to matriculate to
Cornell University to study either computer science or operations research (I
ultimately chose CS), and I headed to [Ithaca][] in Fall 2014 as a freshly-graduated
17 year-old science nerd.

I chose Cornell for its beautiful [landscapes][], picturesque [winters][], rigorous
academics, and of course, its far distance from home (sorry Mom and Dad!). In my
mind, Cornell was the epitome of what I had always wanted—a collection of scholarly
people who also knew how to have fun when needed.

Currently, I am a senior at Cornell.

My experiences at Cornell aren't too different from what I had expected. At times
it is disillusioning, even humbling, to be in the presence of so many people who
are far superior to me intellectually. But I am able to learn a lot from these
wonderful people, and to me, that's what makes Cornell really great. Go Big Red!

At Cornell, I take unusual classes (like [applied logic][4860]), participate
in unusual activities (like [Splash!][splash]), and have unusual colleagues for
friends (no comment).

I mostly stick around areas like theory of computation, programming languages,
and computer architecture, as the intersection of these areas forms the core of
my current research interests and my research project with Prof. Adrian Sampson.
However, that is not to say that I don't dabble around other departments occasionally.
I have also hopped around physics, economics, linguistics, electrical engineering,
and even [nuclear science][nuclear].

Overall, Cornell is a wonderful experience, and although it has taken me a while
to appreciate it fully, I really love every bit of it. Ithaca can be [bleak][] at
times, but it's way better than Starkfield, MA, I'll give it that. I think the
lovely flora in the [spring][] really makes up for the winters where the
temperatures hit 30 below zero. How can you say no to cherry blossom trees?

P.S. [CKB][] is the best dorm ever. I lived in 2 Court in 2014-2015. Amazing
experiences, yo.

### Graduate studies

I will be attending graduate school in Fall 2017. I'm still on the fence between
two schools, but it'll be fun either way, I imagine. Ultimately, I would really
like to pursue a Ph.D. and then enter academia on the faculty of a respected
institution as I continue to do my research. Of course, that dream is far, far
away, and I am still quite young. Small steps.
