### General information

If you'd like to get in touch, please shoot me an email at [{{ site.email }}][email].
Alternatively, if you're around the greater Princeton area, feel free to ask me
to meet up somewhere! I'd love to chat over some [Hoagie Haven][hoagie].

### Personal projects

I post code on [Github][] every now and then. I'm looking to be more active on
Github in the future. Let me know if you have ideas for projects!


### Professional connections

You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn][] if you know me personally or
academically. I keep my profile updated through the end of a semester, so any
changes that occur during a semester won't likely be reflected for a few months,
as my time is quite limited while in school.
