### General information

If you'd like to get in touch, please shoot me an email at [{{ site.email }}][email].
Alternatively, if you're around the greater Princeton area, feel free to ask me
to meet up somewhere! I'd love to chat over some [Hoagie Haven][hoagie].

### Personal projects

I also have a few projects on [Github][] that are worth checking out. Notably:

  * [Ro][], a functional-like imperative language for modern programming that I am
    writing with [Peter Li][peter]. Right now, we only have specs and markups
    done, but we really want to jump right in and get a working lexer and parser
    using `ocamllex` and `menhir`.

  * [PokéSnowdown][poke], a winter-themed spin-off of Pokémon Showdown that
    [Matthew Zang][zang] and I wrote with some other teammates over the course of
    six weeks for our final project in CS 3110. We won the award for the
    [best final project][hall-fame] of the semester. We have since open-sourced
    this project.

  * [Cryptography][crypto], which is an in-progress repository containing my
    solutions to the Cryptopals' [cryptography challenge][pals] (which in turn
    is based on the Matasano cryptography challenge) in [OCaml][].
    
  * This [website][site] itself—it is a work in progress, of course.

Feel free to ask to contribute to any of these projects by submitting a pull request!
I'm looking to be more active on Github in the future.


### Professional connections

You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn][] if you know me personally or
academically. I keep my profile updated through the end of a semester, so any
changes that occur during a semester won't likely be reflected for a few months,
as my time is quite limited while in school.


### Intellectual outlets

I used to be quite active on [Quora][], but I no longer have the time to contribute
my personal opinions on a large number of matters on the site. This is mainly
because Quora can be quite addicting (having a large amount of people to talk to
can be quite exhilarating, which explains the appeal of Quora, similar to the
potency of Reddit amongst modern social media outlets). I also don't really like
how the community on Quora has changed in the last few years, so I tend to not
use it as much as I used to back when I was in high school and in my early
undergraduate years.

These days, I am trying my hand at [blogging][blog] my thoughts and academic
ideas instead, which I think could be very interesting to keep a log of.
