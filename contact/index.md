### General information

If you'd like to get in touch, please shoot me an email at [{{ site.email }}][email].
Alternatively, if you're around the greater Princeton area, feel free to ask me
to meet up somewhere! I'd love to chat over some [Hoagie Haven][hoagie].

### Personal projects

I share code on [Github][] every now and then. I'm looking to be more active in
the future. Let me know if you have ideas for projects! Here are some notable ones:

  * [Ro][], an imperative language for modern programming that I am writing with
    [Peter Li][peter]. Right now, we only have specs and markups done, but we
    want to eventually jump in and get a working lexer and parser using `ocamllex`
    or `menhir`.

  * [PokéSnowdown][poke], a winter-themed spin-off of Pokémon Showdown that
    [Matthew Zang][zang] and I wrote with some other teammates over the course of
    six weeks for our final project in CS 3110. We won the award for the
    [best final project][hall-fame] of the semester. We have since open-sourced
    this project.

  * [Cryptography][crypto], which is an in-progress repository containing my
    solutions to the Cryptopals' [cryptography challenge][pals] (which in turn
    is based on the Matasano cryptography challenge) in [OCaml][].
    
  * This [website][site] itself—it is a work in progress, of course.

Feel free to ask to contribute to any of these projects by submitting a pull request!


### Professional connections

You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn][] if you know me personally or
academically. I keep my profile updated through the end of a semester, so any
changes that occur during a semester won't likely be reflected for a few months,
as my time is quite limited while in school.
