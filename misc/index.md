excerpt: |
  I do a lot of things in my life, and none of them really fit neatly into one category. Describing them all in a decentralized way is probably the only way I could do it. Mainly, though, I teach, I play the piano, I listen to some sweet music, and I learn things for fun.

## Music

----

### [Classical works][repertoire]

I've been playing the piano since April 2005\. Growing up, I was trained to play
Western classical and baroque music. I still remember the days of Hanon exercises
as if it were yesterday. I have a lot of love for the instrument, and it is one
of the few things from my childhood that I still treasure today. Being able to
understand the instrument, even at an admittedly amateur level, has helped me
connect better with my calmer self and develop peace of mind during my most
turbulent moments.

These days, I still explore the vast literature of classical works to see what
skills I can improve on and how I can become a better pianist. I mostly play a
lot of Bach, Chopin, and Debussy. However, with some more experience, I hope to
eventually explore works by Rachmaninoff, Ravel, and even Liszt.

I maintain a [list of all of the classical music][repertoire] that I like to
listen to when studying and when doing less-stressful activities, such as yoga.
Most of this music is written for solo piano, and many are my choice favorite
pieces from when I was growing up. I hope to eventually put up recordings of
everything.

I also have dabbled in the French horn since September 2008, though my knowledge
of horn music and horn solos are quite limited compared to what I know about the
piano. It's difficult to get access to French horns when compared to pianos...

### [Rock on!][playlist]

I also have a large [virtual collection of rock-esque music][playlist] sitting
around for the interested. I'd like to think that it is organized quite neatly.
[Beets][] helps there. Interestingly, Beets was created by my undergraduate
research advisor back when *he* was a graduate student. How sweet is that?

Most of my favorite music falls into one of these categories:
  * Alternative rock and progressive rock
  * Pop/post-punk, new wave, and power pop
  * Folk/indie rock, funk, and smooth jazz
  * R&B, soul, gospel, and rock 'n' roll
  * Surf/soft rock
  * Ethereal/dream pop
  * World/ethnic music

If you want to read the back story on how I came to like this kind of music,
feel free to [check it out][back-story].

### [OSTs and scored music][ost]

Occasionally, I listen to original soundtracks (OSTs) or music scored for such
media as television programs, films, and video games. I mostly tend to stay away
from this kind of music, as a lot of it is contextual and hard to listen to otherwise,
but I've recently grown interested in Japanese OSTs for animes and even some
Italian film scores. In particular, some artists who I've been drawn towards include
Joe Hisaishi and Roberto Cacciapaglia, who produce excellent works for solo piano
(which often get included as OSTs in animated films and the like).

Of course, I also love [Kevin Macleod][macleod]'s instrumental music. Macleod is
quite prolific, and a lot of the work that he produces falls within the genres
that I enjoy. Of course, I couldn't go without saying that I really, really
appreciate the free licensing that he has, as well.

Unsurprisingly, I also have [a collection of instrumental OSTs][ost] that I listen
to from time to time when the other stuff gets mundane.

## Autodidacticism

----

`def` **au·to·di·dac·ti·cism** (*noun*) `:` Any self-directed learning or self-education.

Whenever I get free time, I like to read and learn new things. Over the years, I
have found that this penchant has led me to possess a richer vocabulary and a
thirst to understand more of the world than I would have otherwise. In recent
years, I haven't had nearly as much free time as I have had in the past, so I find
that I am not able to learn as much on my own terms as I once was (c.f. high
school).

Some of the more recent projects on which I have embarked include the following:

### [Irodov's *Problems in General Physics*][irodov]

Despite learning physics twice in high school and taking two classes on waves and
quantum physics at my undergraduate university, I still don't really feel satisfied
that I understand the material. One of my long-standing goals since I first
learned physics in 2010 has been to sit down and properly learn all of the material
that is typically taught in a third-year undergraduate general physics course
(or, perhaps, two separate courses in analytical mechanics and electromagnetism),
albeit at a sufficiently advanced level. Physics interests me deeply, and I would
love to understand it in more detail, even if it is not my career.

To help accomplish this task, I am [wading][irodov] through I.E. Irodov's
[classic text][gen-phys], which includes about 2000 problems covering all of the
major results in general physics. These problems range from somewhat challenging
to extremely difficult, and form the core of a standard Soviet Union-era text.

I would like to work through problem after problem, typing up my own solutions on
here. With enough time (i.e. several years, since I will be busy with research in
graduate school first and foremost for the next few years), perhaps I could cover
them all.

### Category Theory (in Computer Science)

I must admit that I had virtually no background in computer science or seriously
abstract mathematics prior to university. Although I studied subjects in moderate
depth in high school, most of the mathematics and science that I studied were
applied in nature, and thus I did not have much exposure to the rich abstraction
that underlaid it all. After being introduced to the notion of *category theory*
by a friend in Spring 2015, I became quite interested in getting to know what is
essentially the core of modern computer science.

Of course, to understand category theory, one almost always refers to Saunders
Mac Lane's text, *Categories for the Working Mathematician*. However, I am hardly
a mathematician by any standards, so I have a lot of catching up to do first (on
prerequisite material, such as abstract linear algebra and some algebraic topology).

I suspect that I will be exposed to the tenets of category theory as it applies
to computer science at some point in graduate school, based on [graduate course
offerings][courses] that I've seen at Cornell. Perhaps I could learn it from a
computer science perspective there!

Or, if I learn to manage my time better, perhaps I could just teach myself using
Ross Tate's [CS 6117][6117] notes...

#### Academic subjects that I have learned in the past for fun:

* Linguistics and formal systems
* Basic quantum mechanics (using Griffiths' text)
* Introductory neuroscience and biological neural networks
* Elementary complex analysis
* Real analysis (using Rudin's text)

#### Other things that I have learned for fun:

* Calligraphy (and font-emulation, I guess)
* Audio engineering (setting up a complete stereo system from scratch)
* [Japanese][] (only a little—I would like to do more of this someday)
* Arduinos and microcontrollers (and programming on/for them)
