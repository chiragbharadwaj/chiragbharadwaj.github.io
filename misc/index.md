title: Miscellaneous
excerpt: |
  I do a lot of things in my life, and none of them really fit neatly into one category. Describing them all in a decentralized way is probably the only way I could do it. Mainly, though, I teach, I play the piano, I listen to some sweet music, and I learn things for fun.

## Teaching

----

I really enjoy being a teacher. I have always liked showing other people how to
do things after I have learned how to do them myself. A large part of that is
probably because I often [struggle to learn new things][sagan], so helping others
to have an easier time learning than I did is a definite source of joy for me. I
definitely believe that teaching is one of my favorite pastimes as a full-time
student. I hope to be [teaching][kinds] at some point in the future.

<!-- ### University-level -->

After being inspired by a [cool new lecturer][sid] during my first semester at
university in Fall 2014, I really wanted to teach students or at least be able to
instruct them during times of struggle. In the following spring was invited to be
a teaching assistant in a [class I had taken in the fall][discrete], and ever
since then I have been in love with being on course staff. I have hopped around
quite a few classes in my department throughout my tenure as a teaching assistant
at Cornell. Check out my [CV][] for details.

Interestingly, though, I also have some experience with teaching high-school students.

### Splash! at Cornell

Splash! is a learning initiative/educational outreach program at Cornell that is
based on the [original version][splash-mit] created by students at MIT in 1957.
Splash! sessions are usually held over a weekend, and university students at the
affiliated chapter teach hundreds of high school students all sorts of subjects
that they are interested in. The [Cornell Splash! chapter][splash-cu] started in
Fall 2014, when I was a first-semester freshman. I have been a part of Splash!
since the very beginning, and the teaching and love it fosters for education
makes it one of my favorite activities at school.

I tend to teach mathematically-heavy material in spring semesters and more accessible
material (usually in the humanities) in fall semesters. Here are some of the things
that I've taught before:

### Independent Study Organization

Back when I was in [high school][sbhs], I created an organization for independent
study (eponymously-named) where interested teachers like myself could teach younger
students advanced material. I attracted another scholar, [Davis Liu][davis]
(Princeton '17), who saw the value in teaching and agreed to volunteer his time
and co-teach with me on Sundays. We would go to the local Princeton library
together and teach selected material from [AP Calculus-AB][calc-ab] from
September through May, having learned the material ourselves in the 8th grade.

In particular, our efforts differed from those of standard tutors inasmuch as we
taught the entire curriculum to interested students at an accelerated pace.
Moreover, we did not charge for this program, and instead volunteered, assuming
the printing and administrative overhead costs personally. Davis and I together
taught from September 2010 to May 2013, and then I taught alone in my senior year
of high school, after Davis had already graduated. We attracted a lot of students
because, although our [school curriculum][sbhs-curr] was [quite rigorous][cakir],
a lot of students did not understand how to learn by themselves, so we helped
bridge the gap as older, more experienced students.

Over the years, we collectively taught over 20 interested students, each of whom
took the AP Calculus-AB exam in May and received a score of 4 or 5. We particularly
prided ourselves upon the fact that we did *not* spoon-feed the younger students,
but rather taught them to teach themselves, and provided just enough materials
for them to be able to succeed while asking important questions.

After I graduated from high school, this program ran into legacy mode, and some
former students of ours helped keep it alive for two more years, until *they*
graduated in 2016\. The remnants of the original program can still be found
scattered across the Internet.

* Once upon a time, we maintained a [Google site][iso] for this course, though
  admittedly most of our correspondence was over email. The last-updated date of
  March 3, 2012 says more than enough.

* All of the files we used to run the course can be found on [Dropbox][iso-dropbox].

## Music

----

### Classical piano

I've been playing the piano since April 2005\. Growing up, I was trained to play
classical, baroque, and (rarely) jazz music. I still remember the days of Hanon
exercises as if it were yesterday. I have a lot of love for the piano, and it is
one of the few things from my childhood that I still treasure today. Being able
to understand the instrument, even at an admittedly piss-poor level, has helped
me connect better with my calmer self and develop peace of mind during my most
turbulent moments.

These days, I still explore the vast literature of classical works to see what
skills I can improve on and how I can become a better pianist. I mostly play a
lot of Bach, Chopin, and Debussy. However, with some more experience, I hope to
eventually explore works by Rachmaninoff, Ravel, and even Liszt.

My [full repertoire][repertoire], while unimpressive by professional standards,
contains a few of my choice favorite pieces from when I was growing up. I hope
to eventually put up recordings of every piece I've learned to date, but for now
that list is rather incomplete.

### Rock on!

I have a large [virtual collection of music][playlist] sitting around for the
interested. I'd like to think that it is organized quite neatly. [Beets][] helps
there. Interestingly, it was created by my undergraduate research advisor when
he was a graduate student. How sweet is that?

Most of my favorite music falls into one of these categories:
  * Alternative rock
  * Progressive rock
  * Pop-punk
  * Rock and roll
  * Folk/indie rock
  * New wave and power pop
  * R&B, soul, and gospel
  * Surf/soft rock
  * Baroque pop/rock
  * Ethereal/dream pop

If you want to read the back story on how I came to like this kind of music,
feel free to [check it out][back-story].

## Autodidacticism

----

`def` **au·to·di·dac·ti·cism** (*noun*) `:` Any self-directed learning or self-education.

Whenever I get free time, I like to read and learn new things. Over the years, I
have found that this penchant has led me to possess a richer vocabulary and a
thirst to understand more of the world than I would have otherwise. In recent
years, I haven't had nearly as much free time as I have had in the past, so I find
that I am not able to learn as much on my own terms as I once was (c.f. high
school).

Some of the more recent projects on which I have embarked include the following:

### Irodov's *Problems in General Physics*

Despite learning physics twice in high school and taking two classes on waves and
quantum physics at university, I still don't really feel satisfied that I understand
the material. One of my long-standing goals since I first learned physics in 2010
has been to sit down and properly learn all of the material that is typically
taught in a third-year undergraduate general physics course (or, perhaps, two
separate courses in analytical mechanics and electromagnetism), albeit at a
sufficiently advanced level.

To help accomplish this task, I am wading through I.E. Irodov's
[classic text][gen-phys], which includes about 2000 problems covering all of the
major results in general physics. These problems range from somewhat challenging
to extremely difficult, and form the core of a standard Soviet Union-era text.

I would like to wade through problem after problem, typing up my own solutions on
here. With enough time (i.e. several years), perhaps I could cover them all. My
(incomplete) solutions can be found [here][irodov]. 

### Category Theory (in Computer Science)

I must admit that I had virtually no background in computer science or seriously
abstract mathematics prior to university. Although I studied subjects in moderate
depth in high school, most of the mathematics and science that I studied were
applied in nature, and thus I did not have much exposure to the rich abstraction
that underlaid it all. After being introduced to the notion of *category theory*
by a friend in Spring 2015, I became quite interested in getting to know what is
essentially the core of modern computer science.

Of course, to understand category theory, one almost always refers to Saunders
Mac Lane's text, *Categories for the Working Mathematician*. However, I am hardly
a mathematician by any standards, so I have a lot of catching up to do first (on
prerequisite material, such as abstract linear algebra and some algebraic topology).

I suspect that I will be exposed to the tenets of category theory as it applies
to computer science at some point in graduate school, based on [graduate course
offerings][courses] that I've seen at Cornell. Perhaps I could learn it from a
computer science perspective there!

Or, if I learn to manage my time better, perhaps I could just teach myself using
Ross Tate's [CS 6117][6117] notes...
