title: Miscellaneous
excerpt: |
  I do a lot of things in my life, and none of them really fit neatly into one category. Describing them all in a decentralized way is probably the only way I could do it. Mainly, though, I teach, I play the piano, I listen to some sweet music, and I learn things for fun.

## Teaching

----

I really enjoy being a teacher. I have always liked showing other people how to
do things after I have learned how to do them myself. A large part of that is
probably because I often [struggle to learn new things][sagan], so helping others
to have an easier time learning than I did is a definite source of joy for me. I
definitely believe that teaching is one of my favorite pastimes as a full-time
student. I hope to be [teaching][kinds] at some point in the future.

<!-- ### University-level -->

After being inspired by a [cool new lecturer][sid] during my first semester at
university in Fall 2014, I really wanted to teach students or at least be able to
instruct them during times of struggle. In the following spring was invited to be
a teaching assistant in a [class I had taken in the fall][discrete], and ever
since then I have been in love with being on course staff. I have hopped around
quite a few classes in my department throughout my tenure as a teaching assistant
at Cornell. Check out my [CV][] for details.

Interestingly, though, I also have some experience with teaching high-school students.

### Splash! at Cornell

Splash! is a learning initiative/educational outreach program at Cornell that is
based on the [original version][splash-mit] created by students at MIT in 1957.
Splash! sessions are usually held over a weekend, and university students at the
affiliated chapter teach hundreds of high school students all sorts of subjects
that they are interested in. The [Cornell Splash! chapter][splash-cu] started in
Fall 2014, when I was a first-semester freshman. I have been a part of Splash!
since the very beginning, and the teaching and love it fosters for education
makes it one of my favorite activities at school.

I tend to teach mathematically-heavy material in spring semesters and more accessible
material (usually in the humanities) in fall semesters. Here are some of the things
that I've taught before:

### Independent Study Organization

Back when I was in [high school][sbhs], I created an organization for independent
study (eponymously-named) where interested teachers like myself could teach younger
students advanced material. I attracted another scholar, [Davis Liu][davis]
(Princeton '17), who saw the value in teaching and agreed to volunteer his time
and co-teach with me on Sundays. We would go to the local Princeton library
together and teach selected material from [AP Calculus-AB][calc-ab] from
September through May, having learned the material ourselves in the 8th grade.

In particular, our efforts differed from those of standard tutors inasmuch as we
taught the entire curriculum to interested students at an accelerated pace.
Moreover, we did not charge for this program, and instead volunteered, assuming
the printing and administrative overhead costs personally. Davis and I together
taught from September 2010 to May 2013, and then I taught alone in my senior year
of high school, after Davis had already graduated. We attracted a lot of students
because, although our [school curriculum][sbhs-curr] was [quite rigorous][cakir],
a lot of students did not understand how to learn by themselves, so we helped
bridge the gap as older, more experienced students.

Over the years, we collectively taught over 20 interested students, each of whom
took the AP Calculus-AB exam in May and received a score of 4 or 5. We particularly
prided ourselves upon the fact that we did *not* spoon-feed the younger students,
but rather taught them to teach themselves, and provided just enough materials
for them to be able to succeed while asking important questions.

After I graduated from high school, this program ran into legacy mode, and some
former students of ours helped keep it alive for two more years, until *they*
graduated in 2016\. The remnants of the original program can still be found
scattered across the Internet.

* Once upon a time, we maintained a [Google site][iso] for this course, though
  admittedly most of our correspondence was over email. The last-updated date of
  March 3, 2012 says more than enough.

* All of the files we used to run the course can be found on [Dropbox][iso-dropbox].

## Music

----

### Classical piano

I've been playing the piano since April 2005\. Growing up, I was trained to play
classical, baroque, and (rarely) jazz music. I still remember the days of Hanon
exercises as if it were yesterday. I have a lot of love for the piano, and it is
one of the few things from my childhood that I still treasure today. Being able
to understand the instrument, even at an admittedly piss-poor level, has helped
me connect better with my calmer self and develop peace of mind during my most
turbulent moments.

These days, I still explore the vast literature of classical works to see what
skills I can improve on and how I can become a better pianist. I mostly play a
lot of Bach, Chopin, and Debussy. However, with some more experience, I hope to
eventually explore works by Rachmaninoff, Ravel, and even Liszt.

My [full repertoire][repertoire], while unimpressive by professional standards,
contains a few of my choice favorite pieces from when I was growing up. I hope
to eventually put up recordings of every piece I've learned to date, but for now
that list is rather incomplete.

### Rock on!

In primary school, I never really listened to music. I was always too busy tinkering
around with random puzzles or playing outside to really care about art. As I grew
older, though, I became a lot more troubled, and some social problems pushed me
towards a really edgy personality by the time I left the fifth grade. I really
started getting into music only when some random kid on the 6:11 AM bus to school
showed me Linkin Park's "Numb" and MCR's "Welcome to the Black Parade". In
hindsight, he was probably just as socially inhibited as I was back then, but to
share an earbud with someone was awesome, and I became absorbed with the lyrics.
Powerful, powerful stuff to a kid going through some personal struggles, for sure.
The emo/pop-punk sound was really nice, and I really wanted to hear more of it.

So I looked for a radio around my parents' house.

I started listening to my parents' radio when I entered junior high school in
2006\. Back in those days, alternative rock ruled over all of the air waves,
reaching all of us troubled youngsters in ways thought unimaginable. I mostly
listened to alt-rock classics from the mid-to-late 1990s and early/mid 2000s
throughout junior high school and high school. I was pretty reluctant to add modern
pop songs to my personal favorites after around 2009, especially as the style
of the stuff on radio changed (for the worse). But man, did alt-rock cheer me up.

In 2011, when I was playing Coldplay's "Clocks", my mom recognized the tune right
away, and asked me if I was using her CD or something. Turns out that she had a
copy of *A Rush of Blood to the Head* that she bought way back in 2002. Crazy,
right? She told me it was one of her favorites, and she was sad she didn't hear
them as much as she used to. I had to sadly tell her that Coldplay's newer works
came closer to the pop side of things, and their sound had really changed away
from alternative rock over the last ten years.

Discovering my mother's love of classic Coldplay, amongst other alt-rock bands
that rose to fame in the 1990s, definitely helped me enjoy it a lot better, though.
In a time when I wasn't really close to my parents, having a common interest in
music helped bring us together (that is, when I wasn't yelling at them for something
that I probably think is a dumb reason today). Ah, to be young.

In 2012, upon a recommendation from a friend from high school that later also went
to Cornell, I decided to check out progressive rock, and man, I fell in love
*instantly*. It was exactly what I had been looking for after getting bored with
alt-rock/New wave/pop-punk for five years. I picked up music from new bands and
old, from the likes of Rush and Yes to Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull.

From there, I branched out into other kinds of music, like symphonic/arena rock,
R&B, folk/indie, soul, and even gospel music. A lot of that stuff is extremely
powerful, and I love hearing musicians pour their raw emotions into the sinews of
their core art form.

The one thing I still cannot stand is the pop garbage that plays on the radio
today. I guess I'm already one of the cranky old has-beens, waving my walking stick
at the young-uns of today and yelling about "proper music standards", eh? :)

These days, I maintain a pretty rad collection of many, many types of rock music
that I listen to whenever classical fails me. Not all of them are in English,
either. There are some awesome Japanese artists out there who are largely
undiscovered in this part of the world, but they make some sweet alt-rock!

I have a large [virtual collection of music][playlist] sitting around for the
interested. I'd like to think that it is organized quite neatly. [Beets][] helps
there. Interestingly, it was created by my undergraduate research advisor when
*he* was a graduate student. How rad is that?

## Autodidacticism

----

`def` **au·to·di·dac·ti·cism** (*noun*) `:` Any self-directed learning or self-education.

Whenever I get free time, I like to read and learn new things. Over the years, I
have found that this penchant has led me to possess a richer vocabulary and a
thirst to understand more of the world than I would have otherwise. In recent
years, I haven't had nearly as much free time as I have had in the past, so I find
that I am not able to learn as much on my own terms as I once was (c.f. high
school).

Some of the more recent projects on which I have embarked include the following:

### Irodov's *Problems in General Physics*

Despite learning physics twice in high school and taking two classes on waves and
quantum physics at university, I still don't really feel satisfied that I understand
the material. One of my long-standing goals since I first learned physics in 2010
has been to sit down and properly learn all of the material that is typically
taught in a third-year undergraduate general physics course (or, perhaps, two
separate courses in analytical mechanics and electromagnetism), albeit at a
sufficiently advanced level.

To help accomplish this task, I am wading through I.E. Irodov's
[classic text][gen-phys], which includes about 2000 problems covering all of the
major results in general physics. These problems range from somewhat challenging
to extremely difficult, and form the core of a standard Soviet Union-era text.

I would like to wade through problem after problem, typing up my own solutions on
here. With enough time (i.e. several years), perhaps I could cover them all. My
(incomplete) solutions can be found [here][irodov]. 

### Category Theory (in Computer Science)

I must admit that I had virtually no background in computer science or seriously
abstract mathematics prior to university. Although I studied subjects in moderate
depth in high school, most of the mathematics and science that I studied were
applied in nature, and thus I did not have much exposure to the rich abstraction
that underlaid it all. After being introduced to the notion of *category theory*
by a friend in Spring 2015, I became quite interested in getting to know what is
essentially the core of modern computer science.

Of course, to understand category theory, one almost always refers to Saunders
Mac Lane's text, *Categories for the Working Mathematician*. However, I am hardly
a mathematician by any standards, so I have a lot of catching up to do first (on
prerequisite material, such as abstract linear algebra and some algebraic topology).

I suspect that I will be exposed to the tenets of category theory as it applies
to computer science at some point in graduate school, based on [graduate course
offerings][courses] that I've seen at Cornell. Perhaps I could learn it from a
computer science perspective there!

Or, if I learn to manage my time better, perhaps I could just teach myself using
Ross Tate's [CS 6117][6117] notes...
