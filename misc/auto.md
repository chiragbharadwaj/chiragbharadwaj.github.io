title: Autodidacticism
excerpt: |
  One of the things I like to do is learn for fun and teach myself new things. It's hard without a teacher, but some academic subjects and some handy skills are definitely possible for one to teach himself. My goal is to become more well-rounded, and learning new things in a variety of fields and practices helps me get closer to that goal.

### Irodov's *Problems in General Physics*

Despite learning physics twice in high school and taking two classes on waves and
quantum physics at my undergraduate university, I still don't really feel satisfied
that I understand the material. One of my long-standing goals since I first
learned physics in 2010 has been to sit down and properly learn all of the material
that is typically taught in a third-year undergraduate general physics course
(or, perhaps, two separate courses in analytical mechanics and electromagnetism),
albeit at a sufficiently advanced level. Physics interests me deeply, and I would
love to understand it in more detail, even if it is not my career.

To help accomplish this task, I am [wading][irodov] through I.E. Irodov's
[classic text][gen-phys], which includes about 2000 problems covering all of the
major results in general physics. These problems range from somewhat challenging
to extremely difficult, and form the core of a standard Soviet Union-era text.

I would like to work through problem after problem, typing up my own solutions on
here. With enough time (i.e. several years, since I will be busy with research in
graduate school first and foremost for the next few years), perhaps I could cover
them all.

### Category Theory (in Computer Science)

I must admit that I had virtually no background in computer science or seriously
abstract mathematics prior to university. Although I studied subjects in moderate
depth in high school, most of the mathematics and science that I studied were
applied in nature, and thus I did not have much exposure to the rich abstraction
that underlaid it all. After being introduced to the notion of *category theory*
by a friend in Spring 2015, I became quite interested in getting to know what is
essentially the core of modern computer science.

Of course, to understand category theory, one almost always refers to Saunders
Mac Lane's text, *Categories for the Working Mathematician*. However, I am hardly
a mathematician by any standards, so I have a lot of catching up to do first (on
prerequisite material, such as abstract linear algebra and some algebraic topology).

I suspect that I will be exposed to the tenets of category theory as it applies
to computer science at some point in graduate school, based on [graduate course
offerings][courses] that I've seen at Cornell. Perhaps I could learn it from a
computer science perspective there!

Or, if I learn to manage my time better, perhaps I could just teach myself using
Ross Tate's [CS 6117][6117] notes...

#### Academic subjects that I have learned in the past for fun:

* Linguistics and formal systems
* Basic quantum mechanics (using Griffiths' text)
* Introductory neuroscience and biological neural networks
* Elementary complex analysis
* Real analysis (using Rudin's text)

#### Other things that I have learned for fun:

* Calligraphy (and font-emulation, I guess)
* Audio engineering (setting up a complete stereo system from scratch)
* [Japanese][] (only a littleâ€”I would like to do more of this someday)
* Arduinos and [microcontrollers][arduino] (and [programming][] on/for them)
