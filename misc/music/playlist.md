## Story

In primary school, I never really listened to music. I was always too busy tinkering
around with random puzzles or playing outside to really care about art. As I grew
older, though, I became a lot more troubled, and some social problems pushed me
towards a really edgy personality by the time I left the fifth grade. I really
started getting into music only when some random kid on the 6:11 AM bus to school
showed me Linkin Park's "Numb" and MCR's "Welcome to the Black Parade". In
hindsight, he was probably just as socially inhibited as I was back then, but to
share an earbud with someone was awesome, and I became absorbed with the lyrics.
Powerful, powerful stuff to a kid going through some personal struggles, for sure.
The emo/pop-punk sound was really nice, and I really wanted to hear more of it.

So I looked for a radio around my parents' house.

I started listening to my parents' radio when I entered junior high school in
2006\. Back in those days, alternative rock ruled over all of the air waves,
reaching all of us troubled youngsters in ways thought unimaginable. I mostly
listened to alt-rock classics from the mid-to-late 1990s and early/mid 2000s
throughout junior high school and high school. I was pretty reluctant to add modern
pop songs to my personal favorites after around 2009, especially as the style
of the stuff on radio changed (for the worse). But man, did alt-rock cheer me up.

In 2011, when I was playing Coldplay's "Clocks", my mom recognized the tune right
away, and asked me if I was using her CD or something. Turns out that she had a
copy of *A Rush of Blood to the Head* that she bought way back in 2002. Crazy,
right? She told me it was one of her favorites, and she was sad she didn't hear
them as much as she used to. I had to sadly tell her that Coldplay's newer works
came closer to the pop side of things, and their sound had really changed away
from alternative rock over the last ten years.

Discovering my mother's love of classic Coldplay, amongst other alt-rock bands
that rose to fame in the 1990s, definitely helped me enjoy it a lot better, though.
In a time when I wasn't really close to my parents, having a common interest in
music helped bring us together (that is, when I wasn't yelling at them for something
that I probably think is a dumb reason today). Ah, to be young.

In 2012, upon a recommendation from a friend from high school that later also went
to Cornell, I decided to check out progressive rock, and man, I fell in love
*instantly*. It was exactly what I had been looking for after getting bored with
alt-rock/New wave/pop-punk for five years. I picked up music from new bands and
old, from the likes of Rush and Yes to Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull.

From there, I branched out into other kinds of music, like symphonic/arena rock,
R&B, folk/indie, soul, and even gospel music. A lot of that stuff is extremely
powerful, and I love hearing musicians pour their raw emotions into the sinews of
their core art form.

The one thing I still cannot stand is the pop garbage that plays on the radio
today. I guess I'm already one of the cranky old has-beens, waving my walking stick
at the young-uns of today and yelling about "proper music standards", eh? :)

These days, I maintain a pretty rad collection of many, many types of rock music
that I listen to whenever classical fails me. Not all of them are in English,
either. There are some awesome Japanese artists out there who are largely
undiscovered in this part of the world, but they make some sweet alt-rock!
