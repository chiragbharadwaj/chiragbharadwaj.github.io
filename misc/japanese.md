  I have been learning bits and pieces of Japanese since mid-2015 after working at a Japanese bank for a summer internship in summer 2015. Here are some documents that I have created while studying and learning the language better.

# Japanese

----

After interning in technology at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. in summer 2015,
I grew really interested in learning the Japanese language. The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
is the largest financial bank in Japan, and it has branches all over the world,
including in New York City, which is where I interned. It is commonly a
[choice favorite][favorite] of recent graduates of top universities in Japan, as
it offers financial stability and a great career opportunity.

However, a lot of expatriates do work abroad, so the language barrier was a bit
strong when dealing with my higher-ups as an intern. Although I did not return
to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in summer 2016, I did gain a lot of experience
there, and it helped cultivate a lot of my own interests.

I began learning the Japanese language a few months after finishing work at the
bank, and sketched out a plan in December 2015 as to how I would pull off learning
a new language. I went out to New York City and bought various resources that I
could use in learning the language, and also planned on signing up for the official
courses in Japanese language offered by Cornell, my undergraduate institution.
(As it turns out, Cornell's [Asian Languages department][asian] is commonly ranked
amongst the top 5 in the world.)

Some documents that I used while planning out my studies can be found below.
