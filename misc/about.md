### Bio sketch

![pton]({{site.baseurl}}/media/princeton.jpg){:width="37.5%" alt="In the fall, Princeton is often breathtakingly beautiful." class="rounded" style="float: right; margin-left: 16px"}

I was born in November 1996 in Flushing, NY, which is a small and diverse [ethnic enclave][flushing] in the borough of Queens in New York City. I grew up there for a little while. I don't think I will ever forget the beautiful [parks][corona]. Flushing is home to around 70,000 people, of which about 70% are of Asian heritage like myself, at least according to the [2010 census][census].

I attended middle school and [high school][semifinalist] in Kendall Park, NJ—a relatively quiet neighborhood in suburbia. This part of New Jersey is [downright beautiful][princeton-2] (Note: only Ithaca can be [gorges][ithaca]). There is so much [greenery][princeton-1] and it feels really nice to be surrounded by so much forestry in the Garden State. There are many areas that are designated as "preserved open space", so a lot of the greenery is pretty much legally required to be there. You can even [get in trouble][trees] if you cut down trees! They don't take "The Garden State" lightly...

### Anthroponymic etymology

People often [ask what my heritage is][names] after learning my name.

The ethnic origins of my name are from Greater South Asia. In particular, &laquo;Chirag&raquo; is etymologically derived from the [Parsi][] word `چراغ` ([Chérāgh][cheragh]), which means "light" or "to enlighten". &laquo;Bharadwaj&raquo; is a family name—after [Bharadwaja][], a great ancient sage who lived in the years following the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization. Supposedly, I am part of a family that can trace their lineage back to him across many generations. My parents gave me the first name that I have because I was born soon after [Diwali][], which is a festival of lights. Of course, in Asian cultures, the family name comes first, so historically my name would have been written `भारद्वाज चिराग` in [Hindustani script][devanagari].
