# Axiomatic motivation of calculus

----

## Author's note

In this series of lectures, I present a full derivation of 19th- and 20th-century results in vector calculus. The exposition is done entirely from first principles; in other words, the only prerequisite is the usual demand for mathematical maturity. With any luck, these notes will provide a sturdy foundation of calculus atop which we can later rigorously develop [probability theory][prob].

Note that by "first principles", I really do mean _first_ principles, not third principles as some authors assume. Please see the list of modules below for a clearer picture of the presentation. We will follow the natural order that generations of students have used.

## List of modules

In keeping with the Commonwealth nomenclature, each module comprises several lectures. Please click on the associated links to see a detailed breakdown of lectures per module. The topics listed below survey broadly what each module aims to cover.
