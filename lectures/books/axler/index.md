Axler's _Linear Algebra Done Right_ renders a slightly unorthodox treatment of linear algebra; it does visit all of the traditional topics seen in a linear algebra curriculum, but reorders some of them in order to expose intuition in a logical manner. Most importantly, Axler's text relegates any discussion of determinants to the final chapter of the book. He opts to examine all theorems and results under the lens of generalized linear transformations rather than "bash-y" proofs using determinants. In turn, the text takes a more theoretical route through linear algebra, examining the linear structure of various operations rather than limiting oneself to a purely matrix-driven view, as is common in linear algebra classes within engineering curricula around the United States.

As a result, _Linear Algebra Done Right_ is probably best-suited for students who are learning linear algebra for the _second_ time. This ensures that the main computational instincts are instilled before a broader intuition can be broached. While determinants _are_ important in a study of linear algebra, Axler's ideology that they often get in the way indeed rings true. Thus, the text is less focused on computation and more focused on proofs and structure. There are very few exercises oriented around scientific applications or computationally-intensive arithmetic. For mature students looking to grok a more thorough understanding of linear algebra and its immense utility in a wide variety of fields, Axler's text accords an unparalleled foundation.
