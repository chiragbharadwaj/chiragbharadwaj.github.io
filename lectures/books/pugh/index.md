Pugh's _Real Mathematical Analysis_ is often hailed as a slightly gentler introduction to real analysis compared to more classic texts like Rudin's _Principles of Mathematical Analysis_. However, both texts suffer from the same drawback: their treatments of multivariable calculus are bare-bones, and lack critical exposition on concepts such as Lagrange multipliers and optimization. Additionally, both texts define vector calculus and differential forms in unusual ways to develop the theory of Stokes' theorem. Many students often supplement their study of these lectures with a different text, such as Spivak's classic _Calculus on Manifolds_.

In light of the above, we will limit our solution development to only the first 4 chapters of Pugh's text. Pugh does offer some advantages over Rudin: the former text has plenty of additional problems that require applications to other fields in mathematics, and also clearer exposition with many pictures to help guide intuition. However, the latter text excels when it comes to ingenuity, elegance, and terseness of proofs. Certainly the more experienced student should strive to match Rudin's exposition.
