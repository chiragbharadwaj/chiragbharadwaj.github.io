                Hello! My name is Chirag Bharadwaj. I am currently a senior at
                Cornell University, where I am a candidate for a B.Sc. degree in
                computer science. I'll be graduating in May 2017, one year early,
                and will hopefully attend graduate school in the fall! I'm interested
                in areas like theory of computation, programming languages,
                and—strangely—computer architecture. Outside of CS, I also hop
                around other departments, such as electrical engineering, physics,
                economics, and even nuclear science. </br></br>

                On my own time, I enjoy running, watching basketball, playing
                classical piano, and listening to modern alternative-rock. I also
                actively follow the political discussions within the Asian-American
                diaspora. </br></br>

                Here's my CV [PDF | HTML]. If you would like to get in contact,
                feel free to reach out via email (see my Contact page).

              I participate in undergraduate computer science research at school.
              My research advisor is Adrian Sampson, who is a recent graduate from
              the University of Washington and a new assistant professor at Cornell.
              I find that my interests in computer science are quite an unusual
              combination. Adrian's work is at the intersection of programming
              languages and computer architecture, so working with him was a
              rad option for me. </br></br>

              A lot of our work has to do with developing hardware and software
              abstractions for something known as <i>approximate computing</i>,
              which is the notion that we can make certain systems faster by
              trading off correctness for efficiency/performance, which could be
              useful for applications where 100% correctness is not necessary.
              This is an emergent field at the cornerstone of modern computing
              formalisms, and it is one that I find quite fascinating precisely
              for its ability to combine multiple disciplines. Indeed, knowledge
              of statistics, programming languages, compiler design, and computer
              systems only helps one dive a little into the potential for this
              field. </br></br>

              One of my current research projects under Adrian is the development
              of a GPU-specific instruction set architecture. The goal is to be
              able to write normal high-level code, as is done now, but have a
              nice intermediate representation that could generate efficient
              GPU-specific code instead of the CPU-tangled mess that plague
              systems down to the metal right now. This could help improve the
              performance of computationally intensive graphics code.
