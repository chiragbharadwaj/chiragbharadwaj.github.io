## About me

I work in machine learning, primarily in the recommendations space. A lot of my work focuses on the personalization of items from high-cardinality catalogues over millions of users. The associated engineering challenges of scaling and maintaining these online systems have formed the mainstay of my career over the last several years.

I am currently based in New York.

## Various writings

This site exists primarily to document my thoughts about mathematics, statistics, and machine learning. My hope is that these musings and treatises can also serve as a valuable pedagogical tool for other ML practitioners.
