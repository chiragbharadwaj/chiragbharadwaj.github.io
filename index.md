### Brief overview

Hello! I am currently a senior at [Cornell University][cornell-cs], where I am a
candidate for a B.Sc. degree in computer science. I'll be graduating one year
early in May 2017, and will hopefully attend [graduate school][grad] in the fall!
I'm interested in areas like theory of computation, programming languages, and
computer architecture. I like talking about theoretical things.

Here's an HTML version of my [curriculum vitae][cv] as of December 2016.

I love talking about my interests and research work, so please feel free to reach
out if you'd like to know more!

### [Research][]

I participate in undergraduate computer science [research][pl-research] at school.
My research advisor is [Adrian Sampson][adrian], who is a recent graduate from the
University of Washington and a new assistant professor at Cornell. I find that
my interests in computer science are quite an unusual combination. Adrian's work
is at the intersection of programming languages and computer architecture, so
working with him was a pretty sweet deal for me.

A lot of the work has to do with developing hardware and software abstractions
for something known as *[approximate computing][dissertation]*, which is the
notion that we can make certain systems faster by trading off correctness for
efficiency/performance. This could be useful for [applications][] where 100%
correctness is not necessary. This is an emergent field at the cornerstone of
modern computing formalisms, and it is one that I find quite fascinating precisely
for its ability to combine multiple disciplines. Indeed, prior knowledge of
[statistics][], [programming languages][pl], [compiler design][compilers], and
[computer systems][systems] only helped me dive so far into the vast potential
for this field.
