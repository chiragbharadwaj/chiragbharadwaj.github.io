## About me

I work in machine learning, primarily in the recommendations space. A lot of my work focuses on the personalization of items from high-cardinality catalogues over millions of users. The associated engineering challenges of scaling and maintaining these online systems have formed the mainstay of my career over the last several years.

## Various writings

This site exists primarily to document my thoughts about mathematics, machine learning, and data engineering. My hope is that these musings and treatises can also serve as a valuable pedagogical tool for other ML practitioners.

### Pedagogical expositions

- Machine learning from scratch
- Some solution sketches

I also track my progress with my hobbies and interests on some associated blogs.

### Personal blogs

- Personal finance
- Shogi tactics
- Chinese language/literature
