### Overview

<audio id="name" src="{{ site.base }}/media/name.mp3"></audio>

Hello! My name is
    <a onclick="document.getElementById('name').play()">
    <i class="fa fa-volume-up"></i>
    Chirag Bharadwaj</a>.
I am from Flushing, NY. I've also lived in Princeton, NJ.

I am currently a senior at [Cornell University][cornell-cs], where I am a
candidate for a B.Sc. degree in computer science. I'll be graduating one year
early in May 2017. In Fall 2017, I will begin an MSE in computer science at
[Princeton][mse]. I am interested in areas like theory of computation, programming
languages, and computer architecture.

Please feel free to [reach out][contact] if you'd like to know more about my
interests or research work!

### [Research][]

I participate in undergraduate computer science [research][pl-research] at school.
My research advisor is [Adrian Sampson][adrian].

A lot of our work has to do with developing hardware and software abstractions
for something known as *approximate computing*, which is the notion that we can
make certain systems faster by [trading off][applications] correctness for
efficiency and performance. This is an emergent field at the cornerstone of modern
computing formalisms, and it is one that I find quite fascinating precisely for
its ability to combine multiple disciplines. Indeed, prior knowledge of [statistics][],
[programming languages][pl], [compiler design][compilers], and
[computer systems][systems] have only helped me dive so far into the vast potential
for this field.

Some of these [projects][research] involve building new tools, languages, compilers,
and hardware components, which is exciting.
