post_name: Who are the technocrats?
excerpt: The intended audience of this blog is working professionals with moderate levels of math literacy. Much of portfolio management and investment strategies is most easily explained in this familiar parlance. However, not all scientists or engineers have the same degree of fluency in personal finance as they do in their respective domains. We correct this via principled derivations of sound retirement strategies.

On a rainy afternoon in 2023, my close friend Susan confided in me that she felt financially illiterate and it was a source of major exasperation in her life. Unsurprisingly, this lamentation is quite common among Americans today, both young and old. Perhaps more surprisingly, though, many financially-successful technical experts feel similarly. There are scores of doctors, national lab researchers, lawyers, and even engineers who [share][perfin] that they don't understand personal finances. These are often folks with advanced degrees like a masters degree in biology, or maybe a PhD in mechanical engineering.

This always struck me as particularly strange, as scholars from the latter category tend to already be well-equipped to understand the [mechanisms at play][interest] when it comes to accounting and investing. Over time, I've concluded that it may be due to a lack of centralized, _trustable_ resources on the topic. There are plenty of YouTube videos and [TikTok reels][vivian] from armchair financial experts, no doubt, but few tackle the problem from a data-driven angle. Without a rigorous and scientific approach such as back-testing and Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation, noisy soundbites about "surefire strategies" are hardly trustworthy to hawk-eyed scientists. Fair play.

One exception in the content-creator economy might be Dr. Karsten Jeske, author of the [Early Retirement Now][ERN] blog. Papa ERN, as he is affectionately dubbed by his followers, has spent well over 7 years documenting various aspects of how to deal with money during retirement. He admittedly has fewer resources about what one should do pre-retirement, but overall his blog is an enormous trove of wealth for the **semi-literate**. Let's discuss that last word again for a second: a lot of folks may be knowledgeable to _some_ extent about the mechanisms needed for saving and retirement planning. Perhaps you've heard of a 401(k) before, or maybe you're already investing some of your savings. Possibly a 529 plan for your kid.

For a lot of Americans, however -- including otherwise-technical professionals -- all of these acronyms and arcane laws in the U.S. tax code can be a major headache to get squared away. From a [psychological perspective][fomo], people feel secure in understanding that what they are doing right now is the best course of action for them, lest they grapple with internal cognitive dissonance when told otherwise. Some [turn defensive][redditors], naturally, when confronted with the fact that what they're doing is illogical (or worse, [actively harmful][yikes] to their finances). In an ideal world, discussing financial strategies wouldn't be so taboo, but sadly ego often acts as a barrier when reconciling sub-optimality with superior choices.

So what should the Susans of the world do? Presumably, they'd like to eliminate money management as a source of stress: living debt-free, investing well, meeting timely retirement, and building a stable life. Well, as mentioned earlier, the latent complexity of this world obfuscates the path to these dreams. Moreover, there aren't many well-established rigorous texts or articles on the topic that technocratic-types would prefer. So, in this series of posts, my goal is to flesh out exactly that: explain the acronyms, discuss key concepts, derive optimality, and find conditions under which "rules of thumb" hold or break down. I suspect that this [constructive][science] and [objective][bogleheads] approach should sit well in the stomachs of the scientifically-minded. As an aside: these notes are digitizations of a notebook I maintained in 2019, when I spent tens of hours at the Seattle Public Library researching the minutiae of retirement laws; I can only hope that tomorrow's adults find them utile.

Finally, keen readers might note that the title of this blog is **Personal Finance for Technocrats** (PFFT, as in _pfft... that wasn't so hard!_). So who exactly are these technocrats? Broadly, they are the semi-literate: people who understand math equations, can read a little bit of Python code, and can reason through logic. Usually these tend to be people who have [college degrees][stem] in mathematics, engineering, or the sciences, but such dogma is hardly necessary. Here's a simple litmus test: if the following symbols are within your comfort zone, then practically everything we discuss will be accessible.

\\[ C_{total} = \sum\limits_{i \in B} w_i C_i, \enspace \text{where} \enspace \sum\limits_{i \in B} w_i = 1. \\]
