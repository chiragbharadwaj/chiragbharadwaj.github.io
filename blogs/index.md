# Blogs

----

Here are some of my personal blogs. They focus on my hobbies and interests as of now; if I develop any new avocations (e.g. pottery), then I'll be sure to add it to the list below. My goal with these blogs is to track my progress and skillset in a variety of areas.

Please join me on my journey to the modern Renaissance!
