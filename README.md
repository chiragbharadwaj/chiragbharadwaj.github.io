This is the source code for [my personal/academic website](http://www.chiragbharadwaj.com). The crux of the website is written using Jekyll-Bootstrap 3, a fork of the original Jekyll-Bootstrap project. The design focuses on a bare-bones implementation that still manages to look nice/non-clich√©, which I couldn't seem to really find online anywhere.

To use the Makefile, I needed each of the following:
 * A `less` compiler (usually comes with NodeJS, but can probably be installed via `npm`)
 * The `clean-css` CSS-minifier/optimizer (can be installed via `npm`)
 * A static-site generator known as `jekyll` (can be installed as a Ruby gem)
 * A Markdown framework: `kramdown` (can be installed as a Ruby gem)
 * A math engine: `katex` (can be installed via `npm`)

A lot of the inspiration for the way I set up this site in Jekyll comes from [Adrian Sampson](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson) at Cornell University. In particular, his suggestions on [a blog post from 2014](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/jekyll.html) were really helpful. Thanks, Adrian.
